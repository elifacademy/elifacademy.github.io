						   <p>Tufail Ahmad is a leading Indian journalist, author and commentator based in New Delhi. In recent years, his writings have focused on counter-radicalisation and the need for the reform of Islam in India. Ahmad is currently Executive Director of the Open Source Institute, New Delhi. Previously, he has worked with the Press Trust of India news agency in New Delhi, the BBC World Service in London, and the Middle East Media Research Institute in Washington DC. 

                           <br> On 30 November 2016, assisted by two friends Siddharth Singh and Satya Prakash, Ahmad authored and unveiled a 12-clause blueprint for the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) which he described as the Universal Bill of Rights for the Indian Citizen (Ubric). This was the first attempt since 1950 to define what specifics should constitute the UCC, a code of rights for Indian citizens which the Indian state is directed to introduce by the Indian Constitution.

                           <br> For nearly two decades, Ahmad has worked in the areas of mainstream journalism, psephology and watchdog journalism. In recent years, Ahmad has written extensively on the ideology of jihadist organisations operating out of Pakistan and its neighbourhood. His book, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gsfufn8" title="Buy Book" target="_blank"><i>Jihadist Threat to India – The Case for Islamic Reformation by an Indian Muslim</i>,</a> was published in January 2016. He has previously co-edited, The Internet Economy of India (Inomy, 2001).

                           <br> Ahmad had his early education at a madrassa before going to a government school in northern Bihar's Champaran districts where Maharshi Valmiki wrote the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, George Orwell was born and Mahatma Gandhi launched Satyagraha against the British rule. After his schooling, Ahmad went on to study at the Aligarh Muslim University, the Jawaharlal Nehru University of New Delhi, the Indian Institute of Mass Communication, and the Department of War Studies at the King's College London where he wrote his MA thesis on, "What will Constitute the End of the War on Terror?"

                          <br> Ahamd is a columnist with the First Post, Mail Today, Open magazine, and the Dainik Jagran, the largest Hindi newspaper which prints 3 million copies a day. His articles have appeared in several languages including Arabic, Dari, Turkish, Urdu, Hindi, Spanish, Polish, Russian, French, Chinese, Japanese, Malayalam, Tamil and Kannada. His work has been cited in the New York Times, the BBC, the Jerusalem Post, USA Today, the Sydney Morning Herald, Nia Zamana of Lahore, among others.

								<h3>My blueprint for the Uniform Civil Code</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The Constitution of India, under Article 44, directs the government as follows: "The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India." However, ever since the Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950, no attempt has been made by the Indian government to draft a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) for fear that political parties could lose Muslim votes.</p>

								<h3>India’s Thought Cops are Angry with Modi</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Beef conflicts are not new to contemporary India. Cows are not slaughtered across the Islamic world, but the reason cows are slaughtered mostly in the Indian Subcontinent is because Indian Islamists introduced the practice of cow slaughter here as a challenge to Hindu religious practice of worshiping cows.</p>

								<h3>Indian Secularism is Colour Blind</h3>
							</header>
							<p>People are angry at the murder of Muhammad Akhlaq in Dadri over allegations that he ate beef. Some say they are angry at Akhlaq’s murder, while others say they are angry at the murder of the cow. Some people are angry at the cancellation of Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali’s show of 9 October in Mumbai due to the Shiv Sena’s threat, while others are angry at Pakistani actors and singers being invited in India.</p>
